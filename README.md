# CSC-346 Final Project

#### Crime Choropleth Map by Counties In the United States

This program uses crime data sourced from FBI crime reports to color a map that contains all of the 
counties in the united states. First I built the database to contain the totals of all city law enforcement and county
law agency crime numbers. Second I loop through a map that contains the counties of all the states and 
I find the crime rate for each county and find the color to shade the county and apply that color to that county until
 this has been done for all counties. 
 
 Here are some images of the final product.
